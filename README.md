Part A

1)  create a program that reads in the file and echos each line back to the screen

2)  modify program to remove all extra white space and store each non-empty line in an array of Strings called "lines"

3)  modify to remove all punctuation and break down each line into individual words, store all words in an array of Strings called "words"

Part B

Create 2 methods that can help you do the following:

1)  Count how many times a particular word is found in the script.  Use it to get counts for these words:

tesseract, loki, thor

2)  Determine if superhero name or real name is used more often in the script. 

For example, is "hulk" found more or less than "banner"?  Here are others, choose 2.

"iron man" vs. "tony"

"captain america" vs. "steve" (rogers)

"hawkeye" vs. (clint) "barton"

"black widow" vs. "natasha" (Romanova)

For those that had AP or Advanced Topics:

3)  Determine who "tony" is associated with most in the script.

For example, look for "tony and" string and "and tony" in the script.  What other person is most found associated with tony?

4)  Suppose someone doesn't know what a tesseract is.  Grab about 4 words before/after the word "tesseract" and print out the list.  Do they give the user a good idea of what a tesseract might be?  If not, grab a few more words, etc.
